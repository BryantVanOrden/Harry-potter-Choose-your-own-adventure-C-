# Overview

As a software engineer seeking continuous learning, this project was undertaken to enhance programming skills and explore the development of a simple decision-based character assignment system. The purpose was to create an interactive console application that allows users to make choices, leading to the random assignment of a Harry Potter character based on their decisions.

The software presents users with a series of decisions, each impacting their character assignment. The project serves as an opportunity to practice C++ programming, decision-based logic, and randomization within a console environment.

Check out the [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/JpXamyctBVE) for a 4-5 minute walkthrough of the software in action, including a demonstration of its functionality and a brief overview of the code.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools and programming environment:

- **C++**: The primary programming language for building the console application.
- **Online C++ Compiler**: The integrated development environment used for coding and project management.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, several websites were found helpful:

- [Online C++ Editor and Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler): A useful resource for quickly testing and running C++ code snippets online.

# Future Work

While the current version of the software provides a functional experience, there are areas for future improvement and expansion:

- **Enhance Decision Variety**: Add more decisions and branching paths to increase the complexity of character assignments.
- **Improve User Interface**: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Expand Character Set**: Include more characters from the Harry Potter universe for a broader range of possible assignments.
